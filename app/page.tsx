        Hello there! My name is <strong>Sunny Yiu</strong>, I am a{" "}
        <strong>full-stack developer</strong> from{" "}
        <strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>, working with{" "}
        <strong>NextJS, NodeJS, GraphQL, Apollo, AWS, and Terraform</strong>{" "}
        with the brightest team in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am fond of modern TypeScript, infrastructure as code, object-oriented
        and functional programming, computer science, applied cryptography,
        security, networking, and cloud computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I am a fast learner and have expertise in a number of technical
        areas, I believe that <strong>life is a marathon</strong>, not a race.
        I&rsquo;d enjoy living, work, and learn at a steady pace indefinitely. I
        enjoy a cup of coffee like most developers.{" "}
